<h1> Steven Kumar </h1>

 
 <p class="oblique">
I have had my Sun Certified Programming for many years, but never really pursued a career as a programmer.  It has been a long term goal of mine to work as a developer and gain the skills within a commercial environment. Over the last 18 months, I have focused on developing my programming skills and started building a portfolio of projects that I would showcase my skills.  
 </p>

<p class="oblique">
I may not have the commercial experience as a developer, however I am highly motivated and passionate individual who have a keen interest in Java programming.  I am currently programming round my part-time job and have set myself some fun projects to work on. These projects can be view  on the below links.  This year my goal is to launch my first live project (game) on the google play store.
