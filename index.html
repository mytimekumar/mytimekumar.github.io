<h1> Steven Kumar - Portfolio </h1>
 
 
<p>
I have held my Sun Certified Programming Certificate for a number of years, however, it is only during the past 18 months that I have been able to fully focus on developing my programming skills and as a result started to build a portfolio of projects to showcase these. I have uploaded some of my projects to view please see below links. This year I aim to launch my first live project (game) on the Google Play Store.  </p>

<p>
At present I program around my part-time employment, with my long term goal being to work as a Developer within a commercial environment. Whilst I may not have prior commercial experience I am a highly motivated, dedicated and passionate individual who possess a keen interest in Java programming.  I believe that working for your Company would allow me to join the industry in a way in which, I feel, I can make a real contribution.
