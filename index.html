<h1> Steven Kumar - Portfolio </h1>
 
 
<p>
I have held my Sun Certified Programming Certificate for a number of years, however, it is only during the past 18 months that I have been able to fully focus on developing my programming skills and as a result started to build a portfolio of projects to showcase these. I have uploaded some of my projects to view please see below links. This year I aim to launch my first live project (game) on the Google Play Store.  </p>
 
 <a href="https://mytimekumar.github.io/spaceinvaders/">Space Invaders Game</a>

<a href="https://mytimekumar.github.io/pairsgame/">Pairs Card Game </a>

<p>
At present I program around my part-time employment, with my long term goal being to work as a Developer within a commercial environment. Whilst I may not have prior commercial experience I am a highly motivated, dedicated and passionate individual who possess a keen interest in Java programming.  I believe that working for your Company would allow me to join the industry in a way in which, I feel, I can make a real contribution.

I have had my Sun Certified Programming for many years, but never really pursued a career as a programmer.  It has been a long term goal of mine to work as a developer and gain the skills within a commercial environment. Over the last 18 months, I have focused on developing my programming skills and started building a portfolio of projects that I would showcase my skills.

<p>
I may not have the commercial experience as a developer, however I am highly motivated and passionate individual who have a keen interest in Java programming.  I am currently programming round my part-time job and have set myself some fun projects to work on. These projects can be view  on the below links.  This year my goal is to launch my first live project (game) on the google play store.

I would like to thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio.
